/**
 * Composites a phone frame (with a transparent cutout where its screen
 * should be) over a tall screenshot of everything that screen would show if
 * scrolled top to bottom, then slow-pans that tall image up through the
 * cutout on a loop — simulating someone scrolling the real screen, using
 * only two static exports (no video, no live embed).
 *
 * The cutout's position/size (as % of the frame image's own box) and the
 * scroll distance (as % of the content image's own height) were measured
 * directly from the exported PNGs' alpha channel and aspect ratios — see the
 * commit that introduced this file for the exact pixel measurements.
 *
 * The CSS animation itself is always attached (so its timing/easing is
 * defined once, in the keyframe), but stays paused until this component has
 * actually scrolled into view — otherwise it starts ticking the moment the
 * page mounts, and by the time a visitor actually scrolls down to it, the
 * 16s loop could be anywhere in its cycle rather than at a clean start.
