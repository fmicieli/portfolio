            side-by-side row layout at `sm` (640px) — fine as long as the
            card has a full container's worth of width to do that in. Once
            this grid also splits into two columns at the same breakpoint,
            each card is squeezed to ~half the container, and the row
            layout's text column collapses to a sliver (~30px at a 768px
            tablet width) well before there's room for it. Splitting the
            grid later, at `lg` (1024px), keeps cards full-width (and the
            row layout comfortable) through the whole tablet range. */}
