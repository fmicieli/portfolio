/**
 * Section-to-section scroll snap for everything AFTER Hero's own pinned
 * zone — Projects and Contact. Renders nothing; it only attaches a window
 * `wheel` listener (desktop trackpad/mouse only — see the note on touch
 * below).
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT reuse case study's ScrollMain: that component
 * drives `scrollTop` on a custom `overflow-y-scroll` container, but Hero's
 * pinned-zone math (see Hero.tsx / heroScrollState.ts) is built entirely on
 * top of the plain document/window scroll — swapping the landing page to a
 * custom scroll container would break every one of those calculations.
 * Instead this operates on `window.scrollY` directly, the same axis Hero
 * already uses, and the two systems split ownership of it by scroll
 * position: Hero owns `[0, heroScrollState.range]`, this owns everything
 * past that (see the `isPastHero` check below — Hero has the mirror-image
 * guard in its own `goToStop`). Because both sides read the exact same
 * `heroScrollState.range` number, there's no risk of the two disagreeing
 * about where the handoff line is, regardless of which of their two
 * independent `wheel` listeners happens to run first on a given event.
 *
 * Touch is intentionally left alone (no touchmove interception), matching
 * ScrollMain's own choice for the case study pages: on touch devices,
 * scrolling past Hero is plain native scroll, no snap. Hero's own pinned
 * zone still has its own touch handling for the zoom-through effect —
 * unaffected, since that's scoped to its own zone by the same guard.
